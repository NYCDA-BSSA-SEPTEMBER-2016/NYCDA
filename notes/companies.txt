Because they are trying to solve world hunger.

Because they are hiring. Also because they seem cool. I get their techstack, they work with/for entrepreneurs and they want to disrupt the financial sector. They have a great spot in Amsterdam. Good size also. Everything just works. 2 downsides: -they are actually looking for a mid-level position. -->I just need to convince them I can grow into that really fast. - They aren't really a medical startup. --> Maybe be less picky, they are still doing meaningful stuff.
Would working there fuel my own entrepreneurial growth? Yes, likely so.
