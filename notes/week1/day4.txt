Week 1, day 4

does .call() work instead of new?
Does new create an object? And the constructor fill it in?
Does new only work for Constructors?
New keyword to create a object from a function. We don't have classes. We have prototypes instead.
Class extension through changing the prototype.
Call functions like an object with the new keyword.

You could see a prototype as a template...

THIS is set on instance.

I need to play Factorio, understand the blueprints. Classes/prototype.

function Human (a,b) {
	this.legs = a;
	this.eyes = b;
}


var a = Human(2,4);
console.log(a);
