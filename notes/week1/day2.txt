Week 1, Day 2

ssh and ssl use private and public keys

metaphor:
public keys are like a lock, you can put on anything.
private keys are like a key, that you can use on your lock.

remember the eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" to start ssh-agent.
add key if needed: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


Questions:
Why can't I say times++? //wrong synthax?
Prototypes
Array.map
Array.reduce
Array.find()
Array.indexOf()
Why is it called key-value pairs?// can't find specific metaphor 
recursive function to log all depth of objects in the object.
dot notation for objects does not work in for-loops. Why? //dot notation is easier to read and generally preffered. Bracket notation always fricking works en never breaks. If dot notation breaks it will give a typeError.

Arrays apparently have forEach() built in. Come back to it later.
