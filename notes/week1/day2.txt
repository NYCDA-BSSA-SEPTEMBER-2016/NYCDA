Week 1, Day 2

ssh and ssl use private and public keys

metaphor:
public keys are like a lock, you can put on anything.
private keys are like a key, that you can use on your lock.

remember the eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" to start ssh-agent.
add key if needed: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
alias key is set now. Is under some kind of terminal profile.

Questions:
Why can't I say times++? //wrong synthax?
Prototypes // sorta got it
Array.map
Array.reduce
Array.find()
Array.indexOf()
Array.join // returns all array content as a string, even nested into further levels.
Why is it called key-value pairs?// can't find specific metaphor 
dot notation for objects does not work in for-loops. Why? //dot notation is easier to read and generally preffered. Bracket notation always fricking works en never breaks. If dot notation breaks it will give a typeError.

// Arrays apparently have forEach() built in. Come back to it later.

Get back to all the methods of Array.
Try JSON.

How do virusses spread?

How to create functions that run with large and unknown data?

Can I make a recursive function to log all depth of objects in the object?
