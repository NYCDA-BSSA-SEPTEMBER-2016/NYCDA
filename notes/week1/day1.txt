Week 1, Day 1

semicolons are optional? //YES, 1 small case of issue.
Do while loop need their counter defined globally // Yes seems that way.
soft quotes ("") vs hard quotes ('') // depends on the language, doesn't matter in JS.

Things I struggle with:
+ !== and !true.
+ loops with subtracting counters

For day 2:
+ Mention NaN, part of data types.
+ Also exponential and optionally unary.
