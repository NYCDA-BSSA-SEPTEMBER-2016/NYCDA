	<p>Learned how alogrithms are present in every day life. These step-by-step instructions are also often used for humans (more)<span class="more-info"> e.g. a cooking recipe, an IKEA instruction </span>, but with humans it's often less detailed (more) <span class="more-info"> e.g. it's implied you open the fridge door to get the butter. Rather computer algorithms do not carry these assumptions and truly need to work step by step. </span> Furthermore, the course discusses the difference between linear search and binairy search (more) <span class="more-info"> it shows how binairy search is overall much stronger and faster. Linear search is when you need to search for the number 40 in a 0-100 pool and procede from the beginning i.e. 0,1,2,3, etc. Wheras binairy search constantly splits the pool into 2 equal halves and decides which halve much continue to be searched. </span> </p>
