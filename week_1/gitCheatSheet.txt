// GIT CHEATSHEET
git status = show current status. Use this a lot & whenever in doubt, it also generally shows what to do to fix errors.

git init = mark current directory as git repo. Not neccesairy when cloning. 

git commit -am = commit changes. -a automatically removes files from the staging area that were deleted from the directory. -m allows to immediate type in a message between "", rather than go into vim.

git reset = unstage a file.

git checkout -- <target> = target goes back to stage before last commit to it. 

git merge <branch> = merges <branch> into current branch. Be in the master in order to merge (/pull into) to master. 
git merge -d <branch> = removes <branch>. Only works from branches that have been merged. If unmerged, use -D.

git pull <target> <branch> = pulls files from target branch. E.g. git pull origin master.

git clone <link> = Use SSH for own projects. Https for other. Copy the clone link into the <link>
