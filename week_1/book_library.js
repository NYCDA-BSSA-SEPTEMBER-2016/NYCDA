Book library

Create an object that represents a book:

Part 1 Give it a title property with a value that is the title of your book. Give it a bodyï¿½ property which has an array of strings as the value. There should be at least three strings within the array. This array represents the pages of text within your book.

Part 2 Create another object with the same format, but different title and different body.

Part 3 Now, create a function that reads the book by first printing out the title, then printing out each element (page) in the body. For a book with title "Infinite Jest" and pages "Written by David Foster Wallace", "Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.", and "As a child, he was very precocious.", the output should read as follows:

Title: Infinite Jest
Page 1: Written by David Foster Wallace
Page 2: Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.
Page 3: As a child, he was very precocious.
