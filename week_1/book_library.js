// Book library

// Create an object that represents a book:

// Part 1 Give it a title property with a value that is the title of your book.
// Give it a bodyï¿½ property which has an array of strings as the value. 
// There should be at least three strings within the array. This array represents the pages of text within your book.

// Part 2 Create another object with the same format, but different title and different body.

// Part 3 Now, create a function that reads the book by first printing out the title, 
// then printing out each element (page) in the body. For a book with title "Infinite Jest" and pages 
// "Written by David Foster Wallace", "Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.", 
// and "As a child, he was very precocious.", the output should read as follows:

// Title: Infinite Jest
// Page 1: Written by David Foster Wallace
// Page 2: Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children.
// Page 3: As a child, he was very precocious.
